01/2021 - mmjohn updated to use python 3 on lab cluster

------------------------------------------------

Performs the training and testing of a CNN to predict rho on an phased haploid chromosomes. 
Requires installation of keras, tensorflow, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib.

All python code runs on python2.7, EXCEPT the model training.  That was done in the cloud on python 3.6!  Sorry!

To run, first run the shell script to produce coalescent simulations (requires ms https://uchicago.app.box.com/s/l3e5uf13tikfjm7e1il1eujitlsjdx13)

`./run.ms.sh`

then gzip the results

`gzip all.LD.sims.txt`

Next run the python2.7 script

`python extract.data.py`

This will output a large compressed file called `ld.data.npz`. You'll use this file as training data for the network. (Alternatively, if you want to skip these steps and use the exact coalescent sims we used in the manuscript you can download `ld.data.npz` at this data repository https://doi.org/10.13020/D65M4P)

To train the network, first find a computer with a GPU and get keras and tensorflow installed.  This was done in python3.6
 
 `python3 train.phased.mergenet.PYTHON3.py`
 
Before training begins, the code will print the mean of the training data.  Save that value (should be about 4.8).  
After training the model it prints a json string that specifies the model structure.  You'll want to save that too.  Also the script saves the weights from the CNN in a file called `regularized.merge.mod.weights`.
 
Next gunzip the dir called LDhat dir

`gunzip ldhat.data.tar.gz`

and extract new coalescent sims for testing LDhat and the CNN against

`python ms.file.to.fasta.py validate.LD.sims.txt`

This outputs a JSON file called `test.data.LD.json` and a directory of `pairs` and `locs` files for LDhat.  Next test LDhat by going back to the parent directory, download LDhat from here (http://ldhat.sourceforge.net/) and run:
`python run.ldhat.1.py`

Now run
`python final.test.results.full.model.and.gap.py`

This will print the R^2 and RMSE for LDhat and the CNN, and also perform an analysis on how well the CNN interpolates to new values of theta.
